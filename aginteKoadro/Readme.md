# Control Panel

In this directory you can find the project folder of the Control Panel that is going to be developed for the manager.

This Control Panel is going to be developed using C# using Windows Forms Application (.NET framework). The Control Panel will be able to connect to a PostgreSQL database and will also be able to process that data to show different types of graphic and views.
